# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code Solutions

[**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly event where coding challenges are published every day in December leading up to Christmas. Each day's challenges consist of two parts. These coding challenges get progressively harder each day, and solving them efficiently usually requires an understanding of data structures and algorithms.

I'm putting all of my solutions up as I complete them, additionally going back to complete old puzzles as well.
